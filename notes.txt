Feature engineering
-------------------
Would like to derive variables e.g. density, momentum from known data
See load-grid-info.py to get pressures at altitude levels

# Altitude levels in hPa from ClimSim-main\grid_info\ClimSim_low-res_grid-info.nc

Tips from others
----------------

Polars found to be much faster than pandas in saving very large .csv (though not
clear if forming dataframe included):
https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/leap-atmospheric-physics-ai-climsim/discussion/495128

Nice simple example code showing PyTorch feedforward model and submission:
https://www.kaggle.com/code/airazusta014/pytorch-nn
Another nice simple NN using Keras:

Ideas to progress
-----------------

o Understand physics of each target col better
o Does humidity have significant effect on heat capacity? And cloud/rain/snow content?
o Reciprocal of new features, e.g. heating in K/s will be inversely proportional to density
 for given heat input
o Deeper/alternative network structures
o CNN-type network that scans across altitude levels (mixed with those above and below)
o Batch-based training on whole dataset or much bigger subset
o Try other ML techniques apart from NN
o With existing NN understand tweaks that zero out some numbers etc in case not good
o Would it help to remove old feature columns?
o Would it help to group columns differently depending on technique?

Beucler et al
o Transformed relative humidity to specific humidity for much better generalisation
  https://colab.research.google.com/github/tbeucler/CBRAIN-CAM/blob/master/Climate_Invariant_Guide.ipynb
o Transformed temperature to a buoyancy metric, also improved but only with RH too
o Radiative effects: absorbtion of SW (visible), greenhouse trapping of LW (IR)
o Sensible heat flux: +ve from atm to surface (radiation, conduction, convection??)
o Latent heat flux: +ve for condensation on surface, -ve for evaporation from surface
